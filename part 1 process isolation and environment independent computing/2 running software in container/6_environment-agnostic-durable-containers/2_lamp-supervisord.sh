# test the supervisord restart functionality by manually stopping one of the processes inside the container.

# The problem is that to kill a process inside a container from within that container, you need to know the PID in the containerâ€™s PID namespace.

# manually kill apache2
# docker exec lamp-test kill 11394

# docker logs lamp-test

# When apache2 stops, the supervisord process will log the event and restart the process.
